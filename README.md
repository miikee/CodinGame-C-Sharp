Codingame challenges/puzzles done in C#

These scripts are written in C# to solve the puzzles presented on CodinGame.com.  Excercizes were done to learn C# better, more optimized solutions exist, but this is how I did them.  
Description and rules of each puzzle are kept in .docx/.txt files with same name as the .c files.
